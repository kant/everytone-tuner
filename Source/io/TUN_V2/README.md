# AnaMark C++ Tuning Library

Originally developed and maintained by Mark Henning in 2009, this C++ library is for interpreting and using AnaMark Tuning files (_.tun_ V0.0 - V2.0), multiple scales files (_.msf_), and Scala files (_.scl_ and _.kbm_). These files allow the definition of non-standard scales used for microtuning in music such as in a lot of eastern music styles. Mark Henning's original source code for this library was provided as a _.zip_ file on his website, under the section [AnaMark tuning file format specifications](https://www.mark-henning.de/am_downloads_eng.php#Tuning).

## Features

This library (should) be fully compliant with the [AnaMark tuning file format V2.00](https://www.mark-henning.de/files/am/Tuning_File_V2_Doc.pdf) (Also see section **Goals**).

The following file types are known to be _readable_ with this library:

- AnaMark tuning (_.tun_)
- AnaMark multiple scales tuning (_.msf_)
- Scala Files (_.scl_ and _.kbm_)

The following file types are known to be _writable_ with this library:

- AnaMark tuning (_.tun_)
- AnaMark multiple scales tuning (_.msf_)
- HTML (for scale distribution and sharing)

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to continue to maintain Mark Henning's original library source, and ensure its compatibility with modern compilers and systems. Changes made to the source must still result in being fully compliant with Mark's AnaMark tuning file format specifications.
Along with that main mission, this repository also aims to

- Fully test (have full code coverage)
- Migrate original code to use standard library (std) calls that are platform independent
- Provide full documentation for future users
